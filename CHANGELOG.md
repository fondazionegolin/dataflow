## [0.1.0] - 2025-09-30

### Added

#### Core Features
- 100% local node-based workflow execution engine
- Visual drag-and-drop interface with React Flow

- Type-safe port connections between nodes

#### Data Sources
- CSV file loader with configurable parsing options
- Synthetic data generator with multiple modes:
  - Classification datasets (make_classification, blobs, moons, circles)
  - Regression datasets
  - Custom distributions
  - Configurable noise, class separation, and missing values

#### Data Transformation
- Column selection (include/exclude modes)
- Row filtering with pandas query expressions
- Column transformations (standardize, min-max, robust scaling, log, sqrt)
- Train/test splitting with stratification support
- Missing value handling (drop NA)

#### Visualization
- Interactive 2D scatter plots with Plotly
- Interactive 3D scatter plots with rotation and zoom
- Histogram plots for distribution analysis
- Color and size mapping for data dimensions
- Real-time plot updates on parameter changes

#### Machine Learning
